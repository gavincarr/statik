Adding new driver tests
-----------------------

How to add a new test using the standard test driver:

TESTNAME=stash
TESTNUM=03

# Create a test symlink to driver named ${TESTNUM}_${TESTNAME}.t
ln -s driver ${TESTNUM}_${TESTNAME}.t

# Create a named test data tree 
mkdir -p $TESTNAME/{config,expected,posts,static,themes}

# Copy some initial configs and data
cp -v  smoketest/config/* $TESTNAME/config
cp -rv  smoketest/expected/* $TESTNAME/expected
cp -rv smoketest/posts/* $TESTNAME/posts
cp -rv ../themes/default $TESTNAME/themes

# Run an initial test
t ${TESTNUM}_${TESTNAME}.t

# Edit and adjust as required
