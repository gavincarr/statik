statik is a minimalist static blogging engine inspired by blosxom.
Posts are simple text files with headers, which are used to generate
static web pages (html, atom, etc.) to be served by a standard
webserver like apache or nginx.

No databases or dynamic web infrastructure is required, meaning you
can host your blog on a cheap and nasty vps and still have it perform
like a star when you're slashdotted. The only real requirements are
perl >= 5.8.

Dynamic elements, like comments and comment threads, are possible
with javascript.
